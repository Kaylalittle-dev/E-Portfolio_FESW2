this is the follow along project, week 2 of Frontend Simplified (FES)
The files are HTML and CSS, with assets providing by David Bragg
The image and resume are replaced with my current content.
However the projects overall image and links are not up-to-date, and have been kept the same as to the tutorial from David Bragg.

Animations and transitions have been copy & pasted, but this project will be the template and foundation to future cimilar projects.
